# SEAL - Simulation of Evolutionary Artificial Life
A Capstone Project by David Jordan and Benjamin Russell


## What is SEAL

SEAL is an artifical life simulation where two competing two species, herbivores and carnivores, interact with and evolve in a spherical world environment.


## Building

SEAL is meant to be built with Visual Studio 2013. If you need to use a different version, then you will need to build wxWidgets with the your preferred version of Visual Studio to udpate the binaries.
